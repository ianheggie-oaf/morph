# = belongs_to
#
# Let's suppose that we have some tasks that belongs to projects. To specify
# this assoication in your controllers, just do:
#
#    class TasksController < InheritedResources::Base
#      belongs_to :project
#    end
#
# belongs_to accepts several options to be able to configure the association.
# For example, if you want urls like /projects/:project_title/tasks, you
# can customize how InheritedResources find your projects:
#
#    class TasksController < InheritedResources::Base
#      belongs_to :project, :finder => :find_by_title!, :param => :project_title
#    end
#
# It also accepts :route_name, :parent_class and :instance_name as options.
# Check the lib/inherited_resources/class_methods.rb for more.
#
# = nested_belongs_to
#
# Now, our Tasks get some Comments and you need to nest even deeper. Good
# practices says that you should never nest more than two resources, but sometimes
# you have to for security reasons. So this is an example of how you can do it:
#
#    class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
#      nested_belongs_to :project, :task
#    end
#
# If you need to configure any of these belongs to, you can nested them using blocks:
#
#    class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
#      belongs_to :project, :finder => :find_by_title!, :param => :project_title do
#        belongs_to :task
#      end
#    end
#
# Warning: calling several belongs_to is the same as nesting them:
#
#    class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
#      belongs_to :project
#      belongs_to :task
#    end
#
# In other words, the code above is the same as calling nested_belongs_to.

# = polymorphic associations
#
# In some cases you have a resource that belongs to two different resources
# but not at the same time. For example, let's suppose you have File, Message
# and Task as resources and they are all commentable.
#
# Polymorphic associations allows you to create just one controller that will
# deal with each case.
#
#   class Comment < InheritedResources::Base
#     belongs_to :file, :message, :task, :polymorphic => true
#   end
#
# Your routes should be something like:
#
#   resources :files do
#     resources :comments #=> /files/13/comments
#   end
#   resources :tasks do
#     resources :comments #=> /tasks/17/comments
#   end
#   resources :messages do
#     resources :comments #=> /messages/11/comments
#   end
#
# When using polymorphic associations, you get some free helpers:
#
#   parent?         #=> true
#   parent_type     #=> :task
#   parent_class    #=> Task
#   parent          #=> @task
#
# This polymorphic controllers thing is a great idea by James Golick and he
# built it in resource_controller. Here is just a re-implementation.
#
# = optional polymorphic associations
#
# Let's take another break from ProjectsController. Let's suppose we are
# building a store, which sell products.
#
# On the website, we can show all products, but also products scoped to
# categories, brands, users. In this case case, the association is optional, and
# we deal with it in the following way:
#
#   class ProductsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     belongs_to :category, :brand, :user, :polymorphic => true, :optional => true
#   end
#
# This will handle all those urls properly:
#
#   /products/1
#   /categories/2/products/5
#   /brands/10/products/3
#   /user/13/products/11
#
# = nested polymorphic associations
#
# You can have polymorphic associations with nested resources. Let's suppose
# that our File, Task and Message resources in the previous example belongs to
# a project.
#
# This way we can have:
#
#   class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     belongs_to :project {
#       belongs_to :file, :message, :task, :polymorphic => true
#     }
#   end
#
# Or:
#
#   class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     nested_belongs_to :project
#     nested_belongs_to :file, :message, :task, :polymorphic => true
#   end
#
# Choose the syntax that makes more sense to you. :)
#
# Finally your routes should be something like:
#
#   resources :projects do
#     resources :files do
#       resources :comments #=> /projects/1/files/13/comments
#     end
#     resources :tasks do
#       resources :comments #=> /projects/1/tasks/17/comments
#     end
#     resources :messages do
#       resources :comments #=> /projects/1/messages/11/comments
#     end
#   end
#
# The helpers work in the same way as above.
#

#   belongs_to :post, :shallow => true do
#     belongs_to :comment
#   end
#
# When accessed as /comments/1, Inherited Resources will automatically get
# the post resource so both objects are actually accessible through the views.
#
# However, when using optional, Inherited Resources wouldn't actually bother
# with finding the parent object.

# = singleton
#
# Singletons are usually used in associations which are related through has_one
# and belongs_to. You declare those associations like this:
#
#   class ManagersController < InheritedResources::Base
#     belongs_to :project, :singleton => true
#   end
#
# But in some cases, like an AccountsController, you have a singleton object
# that is not necessarily associated with another:
#
#   class AccountsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     defaults :singleton => true
#   end
#
# Besides that, you should overwrite the methods :resource and :build_resource
# to make it work properly:
#
#   class AccountsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     defaults :singleton => true
#
#     protected
#       def resource
#         @current_user.account
#       end
#
#       def build_resource(attributes = {})
#         Account.new(attributes)
#       end
#   end
#
# When you have a singleton controller, the action index is removed.
#
# source://inherited_resources-1.14.0/lib/inherited_resources/singleton_helpers.rb:37
module InheritedResources::SingletonHelpers
  protected

  # Singleton methods does not deal with collections.
  #
  # source://inherited_resources-1.14.0/lib/inherited_resources/singleton_helpers.rb:43
  def collection; end

  # Overwrites how singleton deals with resource.
  #
  # If you are going to overwrite it, you should notice that the
  # end_of_association_chain here is not the same as in default belongs_to.
  #
  #   class TasksController < InheritedResources::Base
  #     belongs_to :project
  #   end
  #
  # In this case, the association chain would be:
  #
  #   Project.find(params[:project_id]).tasks
  #
  # So you would just have to call find(:all) at the end of association
  # chain. And this is what happened.
  #
  # In singleton controllers:
  #
  #   class ManagersController < InheritedResources::Base
  #     belongs_to :project, :singleton => true
  #   end
  #
  # The association chain will be:
  #
  #   Project.find(params[:project_id])
  #
  # So we have to call manager on it, not find.
